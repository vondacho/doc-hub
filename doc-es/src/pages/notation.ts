// but has no board to press "export" in. The bytes are the export dialog's
// eventstorm-notation.md, produced by the same function, so the download and this
// route cannot disagree.
//
// Rendered per request rather than prerendered: a prerendered endpoint becomes
// an extensionless file under dist/client, and the static handler would guess
// its content type instead of saying text/markdown.
