# Three deliberate absences:
#
#   * The app ports (4321-4324, 1337). No application container publishes to
#     the host, so only Caddy is reachable and TLS cannot be bypassed.
#   * PostgreSQL (5432). doc-registry-db is on the compose network only. It
#     holds the one piece of state in doc-hub and has no business being
#     reachable from the internet, not even behind a password.
#   * Port 22. Both CI and human access go through SSM Session Manager, which
#     is an *outbound* connection from the agent — there is no inbound admin
#     surface to scan, brute-force, or firewall correctly. `ssh_allowed_cidrs`
#     defaults to an empty list and creates no rules; set it only as a
