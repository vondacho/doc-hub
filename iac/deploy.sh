# the password. They are read from this process's environment — repository
# secrets in CI, your shell for a manual deploy — and rendered into
# /opt/doc-hub/secrets.env, which host/docker-compose.yml loads with `env_file`.
#
# All present  -> the file is rewritten.
# None present -> the file is left exactly as it is, so a manual deploy from a
#                 laptop that holds no secrets does not decapitate the host.
# Some present -> refuse. A half-written file boots Strapi against the wrong
#                 credentials, and rotating half of them signs everyone out
#                 while leaving the encrypted fields unreadable.
