# GitHub Actions authenticates to AWS with a short-lived OIDC token instead of
# a stored credential: the workflow presents a token signed by GitHub, STS
# checks it against the trust policy below, and hands back credentials that
# expire with the job. Nothing long-lived exists to leak or rotate.
#
# This is why the security group opens no port 22 at all (see security.tf):
# there is no SSH key for the deploy job to hold.

# An account can hold only one provider per issuer URL, so an account that
# already has one for another repository must reuse it rather than create a
# second. An account already running ba-hub or dev-hub has one — set
# create_github_oidc_provider = false there.

# GitHub mints the `sub` claim in one of two shapes, and which one you get is
# not under this repository's control:
#
#   classic     repo:vondacho/doc-hub:environment:production
#   immutable   repo:vondacho@3777501/doc-hub@1329127385:environment:production
#
# Since 2026-07-15 every newly created repository gets the immutable form
# automatically — the numeric owner and repository IDs close a real hole, where
# deleting a repository and recreating it under the same name let a new owner
# mint the same subject. What this repository actually mints is worth checking
# rather than assuming:
#
#   gh api /repos/vondacho/doc-hub/actions/oidc/customization/sub
#
# It answers `use_immutable_subject: false` *and* an immutable-shaped
# `sub_claim_prefix`, which is exactly the kind of disagreement that makes an
# exact-match policy a bad bet.
#
# So `sub` is deliberately NOT the load-bearing condition here: matching it
# exactly means pinning IDs that differ per fork and per account, and silently
# breaks again the day a repository flips form. The authorization is carried by
# the dedicated claim keys below — `repository`, `ref`, `environment` — which
# STS has validated natively for GitHub since January 2026 and which say what
# they mean instead of packing three facts into one string.
