# there is no SSH key for the deploy job to hold.

# Does the account already hold a provider for this issuer? Asked here rather
# than assumed, because AWS allows exactly one per issuer URL account-wide and
# the answer decides whether this stack creates it or references it. Getting it
# wrong used to surface as EntityAlreadyExists partway through an apply, with
# the security group, the instance and both roles already created.

# GitHub mints the `sub` claim in one of two shapes, and which one you get is
# not under this repository's control:
#
#   classic     repo:vondacho/doc-hub:environment:production
#   immutable   repo:vondacho@3777501/doc-hub@1329127385:environment:production
#
# Since 2026-07-15 every newly created repository gets the immutable form
# automatically — the numeric owner and repository IDs close a real hole, where
# deleting a repository and recreating it under the same name let a new owner
# mint the same subject. What this repository actually mints is worth checking
# rather than assuming:
#
#   gh api /repos/vondacho/doc-hub/actions/oidc/customization/sub
#
# It answers `use_immutable_subject: false` *and* an immutable-shaped
# `sub_claim_prefix`, which is exactly the kind of disagreement that makes an
# exact-match policy a bad bet.
#
# So `sub` is deliberately NOT the load-bearing condition here: matching it
# exactly means pinning IDs that differ per fork and per account, and silently
# breaks again the day a repository flips form. The authorization is carried by
# the dedicated claim keys below — `repository`, `ref`, `environment` — which
# STS has validated natively for GitHub since January 2026 and which say what
# they mean instead of packing three facts into one string.
