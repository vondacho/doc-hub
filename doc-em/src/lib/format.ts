/**
 * The formatter: whitespace at the edges of lines, and nothing else.
 *
 * Ported from ba-ddd-mapper, whose `.ddd` and `.ddm` have the same shape as
 * this one: braces, quoted strings that may span lines, bare words and `//`
 * comments. Nothing below knows what the words mean. What it fixes is the one
 * thing hand-typing gets wrong and the one thing an edit cannot fix for you —
 * where a line starts. Indentation from the brace depth, continuation lines
 * under the thing they continue, tabs expanded, trailing whitespace gone, one
 * newline at the end.
 *
 * **What it deliberately does not do is reflow.** It never moves a token, never
 * rewraps a string, never inserts or removes a blank line, and never touches
 * the space between a keyword and its value. That last one is not laziness: the
 * samples align their fields into columns — `intent    `, `language  `,
 * `aggregate ` — and a formatter with an opinion about inter-token spacing
 * would flatten a deliberate layout on first use. Blank lines are the author's
 * paragraphing for the same reason.
 *
 * The test it is written against is that both samples are already formatted:
 * `format(SAMPLE) === SAMPLE`. A formatter that changes the file it is supposed
 * to be modelled on is not a formatter, it is a second opinion.
