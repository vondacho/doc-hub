 * ba-ddd-mapper's `src/lib/agent/protocol.ts`, with one difference that runs
 * through the whole port: the mapper serves two notations from one page and
 * carries a `Language` on every call, and this app has exactly one. So the tag
 * is a constant rather than a parameter — there is no second grammar an answer
 * could arrive in, and a parameter with one legal value is a question nobody is
 * asking.
 *
 * The wire is deliberately small: one request, one stream of events, no session
 * and no state on either side. The route holds nothing between calls — see
 * `src/pages/api/agent.ts` — so everything the model needs to answer travels
 * with the question.
