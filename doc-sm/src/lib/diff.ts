 * A line diff, for reviewing something before accepting it.

 * been working on — and a review that renders a one-line insertion as "the
 * whole file changed" is a review nobody performs. Longest-common-subsequence
 * over lines, which is what `diff` does and is about forty lines of it.
 *
 * Lines rather than words or characters. The unit that matters in a
 * `.storymap` is the line: an activity, a step, a story, one of its three
 * clauses. A word diff inside a wrapped `note` would be noise about where the
 * fold landed.
