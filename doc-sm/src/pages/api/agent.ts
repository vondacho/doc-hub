/**
 * The relay: browser to Claude and back, holding nothing.
 *
 * ba-ddd-mapper's `src/pages/api/agent.ts`, near enough verbatim. The one
 * difference is the wire: the mapper serves two notations and validates a
 * `language` field, and this app has one, so the guide is chosen by the module
 * it is imported from rather than by a value the browser sends.
 *
 * The key belongs to the visitor and lives in their browser — see the settings
 * panel — so it travels on the request, is used once, and is never written
 * down. This route stores nothing, logs nothing, and has no state between
 * calls, which is what keeps the footer's claim about the server true.
 *
 * It exists at all because the browser is the wrong place to *call* from: the
 * SDK is written to run on a server, calling Anthropic from a page needs a
 * header whose name is `dangerous-direct-browser-access` for good reasons, and
 * streaming through the Node adapter is simply better than reassembling SSE by
 * hand in a fetch.
 *
 * **Never put the key in an error.** The messages below are written from the
 * SDK's typed exception classes and say what happened, never what was sent.
